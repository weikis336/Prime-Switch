# What is Prime-Switch
Prime-Switch is a lightweight extension designed for Gnome 45 and later versions. Its primary function is to manage the state of Nvidia graphics cards on laptops equipped with Nvidia Optimus technology, utilizing the prime-select tool.

# Why I made this little extension.
The extension was created out of a desire to enhance the user experience on  some laptops with dual graphics systems. 
By simplifying the process of switching between integrated and dedicated graphics, Prime-Switch aims to make it easier for us to manage our laptop's performance and power consumption.

The motivation behind developing Prime-Switch was simply for fun and to improve my personal usage of my laptop. Feel free to test and try. 

I know its working on my own laptop, lenovo ideapad gaming3i 15arh05 with the nvidia driver 570
